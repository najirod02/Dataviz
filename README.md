# Data Visualization Lab

The repository contains all proposed solutions for the laboratory exercises completed during the a.y. 2024-2025 of the Data Visualization Lab course.

## Main arguments

- Data manipulation

- Pandas and Numpy

- Inkscape

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

- Ggplot

## Lessons content

Here is a more detailed list of the topics covered in each lab:

- Lab 1: Cleaning of data using pandas

- Lab 2: Data exploration/modification using pandas

- Lab 3: Inkscape

- Lab 4: Plotting with matplotlib

- Lab 5: Plotting with matplotlib #2

- Lab 6: Plotting with pandas & seaborn

- Lab 7: Plotting with seaborn and further case studies

- Lab 8: Plotting wit ggplot (plotnine)

## Assignments

During the lessons, the notebook files contained some exercises in order to test the understanding. 
About Inkscape, as there is no dedicated notebook file, a folder has been created `inkscape` where it is possible to see
the original plots `before_lab03.png` and the final result `lab03.png`.

Each notebook includes exercises to test understanding of the topics covered.
For Inkscape (Lab 3), since there is no dedicated notebook, a folder named `inkscape` contains the original plots showed during the lecture.
In particular, in the `output-svg` folder it is possible to visualize the first version (`before_lab03.png`) and the final version (`lab03.png`) which has been generated for the assignment.
