The repository contains all proposed solutions for the laboratory exercises completed during the a.y. 2024-2025 of the Data Visualization Lab course.

## Main arguments

- Data manipulation

- Pandas and Numpy

- Inkscape

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

- Ggplot

## Lessons content

Here is a more detailed list of the topics covered in each lab:

- Lab 1: Cleaning of data using pandas
    - melt
    - pivot

- Lab 2: Data exploration/modification using pandas
    - lotr
    - concat
    - combining datasets with join and its variants

- Lab 3: Inkscape

- Lab 4: Plotting with matplotlib
    - matlab like interface (state-based)
    - object oriented interface
    - figure and subplots
    - axes vs axis
    - format string for data points and lines
    - shared x/y axis
    - figure size, aspect ratio, DPI and saving
    - labels and legends
    - formatting: LaTeX, rcParams, plot styles

- Lab 5: Plotting with matplotlib #2
    - colors, line widths, line types (similar to format string)
    - line and marker styles
    - axis appearance: range, ticks, tick labels
    - custom legend
    - texts, arrows and annotations
    - subplots layout: subplot2grid, GridSpec
    - histograms, boxplots, bar plots, error bars and continuous errors

- Lab 6: Plotting with pandas & seaborn
    - indexing and selection (column and row)
    - condition-based filtering
    - plotting using 'kind' and transpose method
    - area chart, histograms, bar charts, pie charts, boxplots, scatter plots
    - 'standard' plots, density plots, joint plots (with hue variable), pair plots

- Lab 7: Plotting with seaborn and further case studies
    - 'standard' plots, strip/swarm plot, catplot, linear regresssion, heatmaps, cluster maps
    - subplots with seaborn
    - faceted plots (show specific subgroups of the whole data set)
    - grid layouts: pairplot (auto), PairGrid (map plot functions to the empty grids)
    - case studies: encircling, diverging bars (and texts), diverging dot plot, cleveland dot plot, ridgeline plot, waffle chart, treemap, cluster plot, andrews plot, parallel coordinates

- Lab 8: Plotting with ggplot (plotnine)
    - data, aes(thetics), geometry (geom_* or stat_*), axes and themes
    - 'standard' plots, aes color
    - trend lines: geom_smooth and possible methods
    - layering
    - axis limits: xlim/ylim (deletion of points) vs. coord_cartesian (zoom region)

- Lab 9: Plotting with ggplot (plotnine) #2
    - scaling and scaling color
    - 'standard' plots
    - statistical transformations
    - position arguments (e.g stacked/dodge bars)
    - coordi_flip for horizontal drawing
    - themes (axis, ticks, legend, background), labels and element_*()
    - saving plots
    - distributions plotting (density, reference lines)
    - faceting

## Assignments

During the lessons, the notebook files contained some exercises in order to test the understanding. 
About Inkscape, as there is no dedicated notebook file, a folder has been created `inkscape` where it is possible to see
the original plots `before_lab03.png` and the final result `lab03.png`.

Each notebook includes exercises to test understanding of the topics covered.
For Inkscape (Lab 3), since there is no dedicated notebook, a folder named `inkscape` contains the original plots showed during the lecture.
In particular, in the `output-svg` folder it is possible to visualize the first version (`before_lab03.png`) and the final version (`lab03.png`) which has been generated for the assignment.
