# Inkscape
Inkscape is an open-source graphic editor based on the svg (Scalable Vector Graphics) format.

In the context of dataviz, it allows to edit most of the plots easily. This is useful in the cases where the only matplotlib module of python is not enough to display in a clear way our data and some tweaks are needed.

## Folder structure
In order to put some order on the files generated and used, different folders have been created and can be descriped as follows:

- plots: the folder contains the images (all types of format such as scg, png) of the plots that need to be modified.

- svg: the folder contains the inkscape files (all of svg format) where we actually modify the plots.

- output-svg: the folder contains the "outputs" generated from inkscape from the tab "export".
